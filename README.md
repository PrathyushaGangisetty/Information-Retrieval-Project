# Information-Retrieval-Project
ðŸ“° News Article Summarizer using Information Retrieval Techniques
This project is a web-based news summarization system that allows users to select a news category and generate summaries using two techniques:

Extractive Summarization

Abstractive Summarization

The application uses HTML/CSS frontend integrated with Python-based backend models to fetch and summarize news articles dynamically. Extractive summarization selects key sentences directly from the text, while abstractive summarization paraphrases the content for concise understanding. This project showcases information retrieval, NLP techniques, and user-friendly web integration for real-world summarization tasks.
